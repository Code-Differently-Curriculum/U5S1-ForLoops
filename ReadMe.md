# Return Ready Lab 14

* Part A - Foundations 6.1
* Part B - Foundations Practice

## Part A

### Exercise 01

#### Step 01

In the package `partA.ex01` look at the file `Countdown`  

#### Step 02

* Set a breakpoint in `Countdown` and observe…
  * How the for loop affects code execution
  * How the value of i changes

#### Step 03
* modify the code to count up from 0 to 5
* modify the code to count all even numbers
  from 0 to 20

### Exercise 02

#### Step 01

In the package `partA.ex02` look at the file `InfiniteLoop`

#### Step 02

*  Execute `InfiniteLoop` and observe the
  output

#### Step 03

*  Modify the for loop in `InfiniteLoop` to
   print “Hello” five times

### Exercise 03

#### Step 01

In the package `partA.ex03` look at the file `ScopeTest`

#### Step 02

*   `ScopeTest` is broken. Can you fix it?
*  You should get the following output:
```
 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
 0 1 2 3 4 5
 5 4 3 2 1 0
 2 4 8 16 32 64
```

## Part B

### Exercise 01

#### Step 01

In the package `partB.ex01` look at the file `CountingExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `partB.ex01` complete the `CountUpByTens` per the following:

        Create a program that uses a loop to count.
        The count should start at ten and end at 100.
        You should only count up by 10s - look at the example below

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output (Abe first name Lincoln last name):
```
10
20
30
40
50
60
70
80
90
100
```

### Exercise 02

#### Step 01

In the package `partB.ex02` look at the file `LoopPrintExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `partB.ex02` complete the `FixThisLoop` per the following:

    Modify the existing loop so that it prints "Hello" five times

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
```

> Use LoopPrintExample for reference.


### Exercise 03

#### Step 01

In the package `partB.ex03` look at the file `ArrayLoopExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `partB.ex03` complete the `Challenge` per the following:

    Create a program that has an array of Strings with six unique elements
    Use a loop of your preference to print out each unique element of the array

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```

Tariq
Gio
Sam
